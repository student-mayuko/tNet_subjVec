1 boot time is super fast , around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute .
1 tech support would not fix the problem unless i bought your plan for $ 150 plus .
1 set up was easy .
2 did not enjoy the new windows 8 and touchscreen functions .
3 other than not being a fan of click pads -lrb- industry standard these days -rrb- and the lousy internal speakers , it 's hard for me to find things about this notebook i do n't like , especially considering the $ 350 price tag .
1 no installation disk (dvd) is included .
1 it 's fast , light , and simple to use .
2 works well , and i am extremely happy to be back to an apple os .
1 sure it 's not light and slim but the features make up for it 100 % .
3 i am pleased with the fast log on , speedy wifi connection and the long battery life -lrb- > 6 hrs -rrb- .
1 the apple engineers have not yet discovered the delete key .
1 made interneting -lrb- part of my business -rrb- very difficult to maintain .
1 luckily , for all of us contemplating the decision , the mac mini is priced just right .
1 super light , super sexy and everything just works .
1 only problem that i had was that the track pad was not very good for me , i only had a problem once or twice with it , but probably my computer was a bit defective .
1 it is super fast and has outstanding graphics .
1 but the mountain lion is just too slow .
2 strong build though which really adds to its durability .
1 the battery life is excellent - 6-7 hours without charging .
1 i 've had my computer for 2 weeks already and it works perfectly .
1 and i may be the only one but i am really liking windows 8 .
1 the baterry is very longer .
2 its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable .
1 i can say that i am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied .
1 this laptop has only 2 usb ports , and they are both on the same side .
2 it has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp .
1 everything i wanted and everything i needed and the price was great !
1 it 's not inexpensive but the hardware performance is impressive for a computer this small .
2 this thing is awesome , everything always works , everything is always easy to set up , everything is compatible , its literally everything i could ask for .
1 keyboard responds well to presses .
1 lastly , windows 8 is annoying .
2 everything is so easy and intuitive to setup or configure .
1 biggest complaint is windows 8 .
1 only 2 usb ports ... seems kind of ... limited .
3 it has all the expected features and more + plus a wide screen and more than roomy keyboard .
1 amazing performance for anything i throw at it .
2 the receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and performance .
1 i was extremely happy with the os itself .
1 the new mbp offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months .
1 the criticism has waned , and now i 'd be the first to recommend an air for truly portable computing .
1 i would have given it 5 starts was it not for the fact that it had windows 8
1 ms office 2011 for mac is wonderful , well worth it .
1 but the performance of mac mini is a huge disappointment .
2 they do n't just look good ; they deliver excellent performance .
2 i have had it over a year now with out a glitch of any kind . . i love the lit up keys and screen display ... this thing is fast and clear as can be .
2 the mountain lion os is not hard to figure out if you are familiar with microsoft windows .
1 however , i can refute that osx is `` fast '' .
1 enjoy using microsoft office !
2 incredible graphics and brilliant colors .
1 built-in apps are purely amazing .
1 cons : screen resolution .
4 from the speed to the multi touch gestures this operating system beats windows easily .
1 i really like the size and i 'm a fan of the acers .
2 i opted for the squaretrade 3-year computer accidental protection warranty -lrb- $ 1500-2000 -rrb- which also support `` accidents '' like drops and spills that are not covered by applecare .
1 it 's light and easy to transport .
1 once you get past learning how to use the poorly designed windows 8 set-up you may feel frustrated .
2 it 's been time for a new laptop , and the only debate was which size of the mac laptops , and whether to spring for the retina display .
2 the reason why i choose apple macbook because of their design and the aluminum casing .
1 the aluminum body sure makes it stand out .
2 it is very easy to integrate bluetooth devices , and usb devices are recognized almost instantly .
1 and the fact that apple is driving the 13 '' rmbp with the intel4000 graphic chip seems underpowered -lrb- to me .
3 apple removed the dvd drive firewire port -lrb- will work with adapter -rrb- and put the sdxc slot in a silly position on the back .
1 the durability of the laptop will make it worth the money .
1 well designed and fast .
1 but i was completely wrong , this computer is unbelievable amazing and easy to use .
1 exactly as posted plus a great value .
1 the specs are pretty good too .
4 apple is unmatched in product quality , aesthetics , craftmanship , and customer service .
2 it is a great size and amazing windows 8 included !
1 i do not like too much windows 8 .
1 startup times are incredibly long : over two minutes .
1 also stunning colors and speedy
2 great price free shipping what else can i ask for !!
1 this mouse is terrific .
1 it is really thick around the battery .
1 and windows 7 works like a charm .
3 :-rrb- great product , great price , great delivery , and great service .
1 :] it arrived so fast and customer service was great .
1 tried windows 8 and hated it !!!
1 set up was a breeze .
1 but i do not like win8 .
1 i am still in the process of learning about its features .
3 i had the same reasons as most pc users : the price , the overbearing restrictions of osx and lack of support for games .
1 i wanted it for it 's mobility and man , this little bad boy is very nice .
1 i found the mini to be : exceptionally easy to set up
1 having usb3 is why i bought this mini .
1 the sound is nice and loud ; i do n't have any problems with hearing anything .
1 it is very slim , the track pad is very much impressed with me .
1 the settings are not user-friendly either .
1 thank goodness for openoffice !
3 awesome form factor , great battery life , wonderful ux .
2 i love the keyboard and the screen .
1 however , there are major issues with the touchpad which render the device nearly useless .
1 i 've already upgraded o mavericks and i am impressed with everything about this computer .
1 not as fast as i would have expect for an i5 .
2 thanks for great service and shipping !
3 the performance seems quite good , and built-in applications like iphoto work great with my phone and camera .
2 i did swap out the hard drive for a samsung 830 ssd which i highly recommend .
1 starts up in a hurry and everything is ready to go .
1 yes , that 's a good thing , but it 's made from aluminum that scratches easily .
1 quick and has built in virus control .
1 took a long time trying to decide between one with retina display and one without .
1 i was also informed that the components of the mac book were dirty .
1 the hardware problems have been so bad , i ca n't wait till it completely dies in 3 years , tops !
2 it 's so nice that the battery last so long and that this machine has the snow lion !
1 however i chose two day shipping and it took over a week to arrive .
1 it 's exactly what i wanted , and it has all the new features and whatnot .
1 can you buy any laptop that matches the quality of a macbook ?
1 it feels cheap , the keyboard is not very sensitive .
1 though please note that sometimes it crashes , and the sound quality isnt superb .
1 it is very easy to navigate even for a novice .
1 does everything i need it to , has a wonderful battery life and i could n't be happier .
2 great performance and quality .
3 i used windows xp , windows vista , and windows 7 extensively .
2 i did add a ssd drive and memory
2 on start up it asks endless questions just so itune can sell you more of their products .
1 i have been a pc user for a very long time now but i will get used to this new os .
3 one more thing , this mac does not come with restore disks and i am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer pc 's , also the charging cables are made of the same cheap material as the iphone/ipod touch cables .
1 i bought it to my son who uses it for graphic design .
1 i never tried any external mics with that imac .
1 the new os is great on my macbook pro !
1 i have experienced no problems , works as anticipated .
1 system is running great .
2 easy to customize setting and even create your own bookmarks .
2 the mac mini , wireless keyboard / mouse and a hdmi cable is all i need to get some real work done .
3 it has all the features that we expected and the price was good , working well so far .
1 i work as a designer and coder and i needed a new buddy to work with , not gaming .
1 the new operating system makes this computer into a super ipad .
1 easy to set up and go !
2 i ca n't believe how quiet the hard drive is and how quick this thing boots up .
1 the only issue came when i tried scanning to the mac .
1 i think this is about as good as it gets at anything close to this price point .
1 it 's just what we were looking for and it works great .
2 it 's so quick and responsive that it makes working / surfing on a computer so much more pleasurable !
2 it works fine , and all the software seems to run pretty well .
4 i 'm using this computer for word processing , web browsing , some gaming , and i 'm learning programming .
1 my wife was so excited to open the box , but quickly came to see that it did not function as it should .
1 i wanted a computer that was quite , fast , and that had overall great performance .
1 apple "help" is a mixed bag .
1 it suddenly can not work .
1 harddrive was in poor condition , had to replace it .
1 the on/off switch is a bit obscure in the rear corner .
1 my only complaint is the total lack of instructions that come with the mac mini .
1 the only task that this computer would not be good enough for would be gaming , otherwise the integrated intel 4000 graphics work well for other tasks .
4 i use it mostly for content creation -lrb- audio , video , photo editing -rrb- and its reliable .
1 screen is bright and gorgeous .
1 the only solution is to turn the brightness down , etc. .
1 if you want more information on macs i suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications .
1 it is robust , with a friendly use as all apple products .
1 it is fast and easy to use .
1 and the fact that it comes with an i5 processor definitely speeds things up
1 i have been pc for years but this computer is intuitive and its built in features are a great help
2 nice screen , keyboard works great !
1 i was amazed at how fast the delivery was .
2 i 've installed to it additional ssd and 16gb ram .
1 the memory was gone and it was not able to be used .
1 it works great and i am so happy i bought it .
3 i like the design and ease of use with the keyboard , plenty of ports .
1 it definitely beats my old mac and the service was great .
2 web browsing is very quick with safari browser .
1 i like the lighted screen at night .
2 it is really easy to use and it is quick to start up .
1 i 've lived with the crashes and slow operation and restarts .
2 usb3 peripherals are noticably less expensive than the thunderbolt ones .
1 and mine had broke but i sent it in under warranty - no problems .
1 it 's fast , light , and is perfect for media editing , which is mostly why i bought it in the first place .
2 the battery lasts as advertised -lrb- give or take 15-20 minutes -rrb- , and the entire user experience is very elegant .
2 thanks for the fast shipment and great price .
4 ! excelent performance , usability , presentation and time response .
1 the smaller size was a bonus because of space restrictions .
1 i blame the mac os .
1 in fact i still use many legacy programs -lrb- appleworks , filemaker pro , quicken , photoshop etc -rrb- !
4 in fact i still use manylegacy programs -lrb- appleworks , filemaker pro , quicken , photoshop etc -rrb- !
1 i like the operating system .
1 i love the form factor .
1 it 's fast at loading the internet .
1 so much faster and sleeker looking .
2 unfortunately , it runs xp and microsoft is dropping support next april .
3 first off , i really do like my mbp ... once used to the os it is pretty easy to get around , and the overall build is great ... eg the keyboard is one of the best to type on .
2 it is made of such solid construction and since i have never had a mac using my iphone helped me get used to the system a bit .
1 very nice unibody construction .
1 this macbook pro is fast , powerful , and runs super quiet and cool .
1 it 's ok but does n't have a disk drive which i did n't know until after i bought it .
2 there is no hdmi receptacle , nor is there an sd card slot located anywhere on the device .
1 it came in brand new and works perfectly .
1 it should n't happen like that , i do n't have any design app open or anything .
1 my trackpad is not working .
3 it looks and feels solid , with a flawless finish .
2 price was higher when purchased on mac when compared to price showing on pc when i bought this product .
2 then the system would many times not power down without a forced power-off .
1 the configuration is perfect for my needs .
1 and the speakers is the worst ever .
3 its the best , its got the looks , super easy to use and love all you can do with the trackpad ! . .
1 web surfuring is smooth and seamless .
2 i 'm overall pleased with the interface and the portability of this product .
3 this item is a beautiful piece , it works well , it is easy to carry and handle .
2 it was also suffering from hardware -lrb- keyboard -rrb- issues , relatively slow performance and shortening battery lifetime .
1 it was also suffering from hardware (keyboard) issues , relatively slow performance and shortening battery lifetime .
1 runs good and does the job , ca n't complain about that !
1 it 's silent and has a very small footprint on my desk .
1 the exterior is absolutely gorgeous .
1 it has a very high performance , just for what i needed for .
2 apple is aware of this issue and this is either old stock or a defective design involving the intel 4000 graphics chipset .
2 osx mountain lion soon to upgrade to mavericks .
1 i just bought the new macbook pro , the 13 '' model , and i ca n't believe apple keeps making the same mistake with regard to usb ports .
2 it wakes in less than a second when i open the lid .
2 it is the perfect size and speed for me .
1 the customer service is terrific !!
1 my last laptop was a 17 '' asus gaming machine , which performed admirably , but having since built my own desktop and really settling into the college life , i found myself wanting something smaller and less cumbersome , not to mention that the asus had been slowly developing problems ever since i bought it about 4 years ago .
2 however , it did not have any scratches , zero battery cycle count -lrb- pretty surprised -rrb- , and all the hardware seemed to be working perfectly .
1 after fumbling around with the os i started searching the internet for a fix and found a number of forums on fixing the issue .
2 and as for all the fancy finger swipes -- i just gave up and attached a mouse .
3 i needed a laptop with big storage , a nice screen and fast so i can photoshop without any problem .
2 i like coming back to mac os but this laptop is lacking in speaker quality compared to my $ 400 old hp laptop .
1 shipped very quickly and safely .
1 the thunderbolt port is awesome !
1 the performance is definitely superior to any computer i 've ever put my hands on .
2 it 's great for streaming video and other entertainment uses .
2 i like the design and its features but there are somethings i think needs to be improved .
1 there were small problems with mac office .
1 i understand i should call apple tech support about any variables -lrb- which is my purpose of writing this con -rrb- as variables could be a bigger future problem .
1 i ordered my 2012 mac mini after being disappointed with spec of the new 27 '' imacs .
1 it still works and it 's extremely user friendly , so i would recommend it for new computer user and also for those who are just looking for a more efficient way to do things
2 its fast , easy to use and it looks great .
1 -lrb- but office can be purchased -rrb- if i ever need a laptop again i am for sure purchasing another toshiba !!
1 i have n't tried the one with retina display ... maybe in the future .
2 performance is much much better on the pro , especially if you install an ssd on it .
2 note , however , that any existing magsafe accessories you have will not work with the magsafe 2 connection .
2 the only thing i dislike is the touchpad , alot of the times its unresponsive and does things i dont want it too , i would recommend using a mouse with it .
2 the mac mini is about 8x smaller than my old computer which is a huge bonus and runs very quiet , actually the fans are n't audible unlike my old pc
1 maybe the mac os improvement were not the product they want to offer .
1 i thought the transition would be difficult at best and would take some time to fully familiarize myself with the new mac ecosystem .
1 it 's absolutely wonderful and worth the price !
3 i am please with the products ease of use ; out of the box ready ; appearance and functionality .
1 perfect for all my graphic design classes i 'm taking this year in college : - -rrb-
1 i will not be using that slot again .
1 the os is fast and fluid , everything is organized and it 's just beautiful .
1 they are simpler to use .
1 ! so nice . . stable . . fast . . now i got my ssd !
2 also , in using the built-in camera , my voice recording for my vlog sounds like the interplanetary transmissions in the `` star wars '' saga .
1 i love the quick start up .
1 you just can not beat the functionality of an apple device .
1 yet my mac continues to function properly .
1 graphics are much improved .
2 here are the things that made me confident with my purchase : build quality - seriously , you ca n't beat a unibody construction .
1 it provides much more flexibility for connectivity .
1 i want the portability of a tablet , without the limitations of a tablet and that 's where this laptop comes into play .
1 mac tutorials do help .
1 the technical support was not helpful as well .
1 i got the new adapter and there was no change .
1 so i called technical support .
2 came with iphoto and garage band already loaded .
1 logic board utterly fried , cried , and laid down and died .
2 the sound was crappy even when you turn up the volume still the same results .
1 osx lion is a great performer . . extremely fast and reliable .
1 having heard from friends and family about how reliable a mac product is , i never expected to have an application crash within the first month , but i did .
1 the macbook pro 's physical form is wonderful .
1 the mini 's body has n't changed since late 2010 - and for a good reason .
1 the unibody construction really does feel lot more solid than apple 's previous laptops .
1 3d rendering slows it down considerably .
1 got this mac mini with os x mountain lion for my wife .
3 fast , great screen , beautiful apps for a laptop ; priced at 1100 on the apple website ; amazon had it for 1098 + tax - plus i had a 10 % off coupon from amazon-cost me 998 plus tax - 1070 - otd !

1 12.44 seconds to boot .
1 all the ports are much needed since this is my main computer .
5 the like new condition of the imac mc309ll/a on amazon is at $ 900 + level only , and it is a quad-core 2.5 ghz cpu -lrb- similar to the $ 799 mini -rrb- , with radeon hd 6750m 512mb graphic card -lrb- this mini is integrated intel 4000 card -rrb- , and it even comes with wireless apple keyboard and mouse , all put together in neat and nice package .
1 put a cover on it and is a little better but that is my only complaint .
1 within a few hours i was using the gestures unconsciously .
2 this mac does come with an extender cable and i 'm using mine right now hoping the cable will stay nice for the many years i plan on using this mac .
1 the 2.9ghz dual-core i7 chip really out does itself .
1 it is pretty snappy and starts up in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me .
1 not sure on windows 8 .
1 my one complaint is that there was no internal cd drive .
2 this newer netbook has no hard drive or network lights .
1 i was having a though time deciding between the 13 '' macbook air or the macbook pro 13 '' -lrb- both baseline models , priced at 1,200 $ retail -rrb-
2 not too expense and has enough storage for most users and many ports .
1 the audio volume is quite low and virtually unusable in a room with any background activity .
1 it is lightweight and the perfect size to carry to class .
1 i was given a demonstration of windows 8 .
1 the mbp is beautiful has many wonderful capabilities .
1 i thought that it will be fine , if i do some settings .
1 runs very smoothly .
2 boot-up slowed significantly after all windows updates were installed .
1 more likely it will require replacing the logic board once they admit they have a problem and come up with a solution .
4 it was important that it was powerful enough to do all of the tasks he needed on the internet , word processing , graphic design and gaming .
5 i like the mini mac it was easy to setup and install , but i am learning as i go and could use a tutorial to learn how to use some of the features i was use to on the pc especially the right mouse click menu .
1 runs real quick .
1 buy the separate ram memory and you will have a rocket !
1 since the machine 's slim profile is critical to me , that was a problem .
3 wifi capability , disk drive and multiple usb ports to connect scale and printers was all that was required .
3 the sd card reader is slightly recessed and upside down -lrb- the nail slot on the card can not be accessed -rrb- , if this was a self ejecting slot this would not be an issue , but its not .
2 soft touch , anodized aluminum with laser cut precision and no flaws .
2 simple details , crafted aluminium and real glass make this laptop blow away the other plastic ridden , bulky sticker filled laptops .
1 first of all yes this is a mac and it has that nice brushed aluminum .
4 after all was said and done , i essentially used that $ 450 savings to buy 16gb of ram , two seagate momentus xt hybrid drives and an owc upgrade kit to install the second hard drive .
1 the dell inspiron is fast and has a number pad on the keyboard , which i miss on my apple laptops .
1 i was concerned that the downgrade to the regular hard drive would make it unacceptably slow but i need not have worried - this machine is the fastest i have ever owned ...
1 this one still has the cd slot .
1 no hdmi port .
1 i had to install mountain lion and it took a good two hours .
1 customization on mac is impossible .
2 i am replacing the hd with a micron ssd soon .
2 plus two finger clicking as a replacement for the right click button is surprisingly intuitive .
1 the superdrive is quiet .
3 the power plug has to be connected to the power adaptor to charge the battery but wo n't stay connected .
1 the battery was completely dead , in fact it had grown about a quarter inch thick lump on the underside .
1 if yo like practicality this is the laptop for you .
1 the os is great .
2 i tried several monitors and several hdmi cables and this was the case each time .
1 cons : price is a bit ridiculous , kinda heavy .
1 the troubleshooting said it was the ac adaptor so we ordered a new one .
2 fan only comes on when you are playing a game .
1 which it did not have , only 3 usb 2 ports .
1 no startup disk was not included but that may be my fault .
1 there is no "tools" menu .
1 it is very fast and has everything that i need except for a word program .
2 needs a cd/dvd drive and a bigger power switch .
2 my laptop with windows 7 crashed and i did not want windows 8 .
2 easy to install also small to leave anywhere at your bedroom also very easy to configure for adsl cable or wifi .
1 nice packing .
1 i switched to this because i wanted something different , even though i miss windows .
1 apple no longer includes idvd with the computer and furthermore , apple does n't even offer it anymore !
1 i also wanted windows 7 , which this one has .
1 at first , i feel a little bit uncomfortable in using the mac system .
1 i am used to computers with windows so i am having a little difficulty finding my way around .
3 it just works out of the box and you have a lot of cool software included with the os .
1 its as advertised on here ... it works great and is not a waste of money !
1 runs like a champ ...
2 premium price for the os more than anything else .
1 i was a little concerned about the touch pad based on reviews , but i 've found it fine to work with .
1 the sound as mentioned earlier is n't the best , but it can be solved with headphones .
2 however , the experience was great since the os does not become unstable and the application will simply shutdown and reopen .
1 if you ask me , for this price it should be included .
1 the battery is not as shown in the product photos .
1 shipping was quick and product described was the product sent and so much more ...
1 the retina display display make pictures i took years ago jaw dropping .
1 the mac mini is probably the simplest example of compact computing out there .
1 instead , i 'll focus more on the actual performance and feature set of the hardware itself so you can make an educated decision on which mac to buy .
5 other ports include firewire 800 , gigabit ethernet , magsafe port , microphone jack .
3 additionally , there is barely a ventilation system in the computer , and even the simple activity of watching videos let alone playing steam games causes the laptop to get very very hot , and in fact impossible to keep on lap .
2 chatting with acer support , i was advised the problem was corrupted operating system files .
1 it 's been a couple weeks since the purchase and i 'm struggle with finding the correct keys -lrb- but that was expected -rrb- .
1 many people complain about the new os , and it 's urgent for apple to fix it asap !
2 now that i have upgraded to lion i am much happier about mac os and have just bought an imac for office .
2 user upgradeable ram and hdd .
1 but i wanted the pro for the cd/dvd player .
3 i was a little worry at first because i do n't have a lot of experience with os.x and windows has always been second nature to me after many years of using windows .
2 with the softwares supporting the use of other os makes it much better .
1 i then upgraded to mac os x 10.8 "mountain lion" .
1 i was considering buying the air , but in reality , this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient , even though it 's about .20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier .
1 at home and the office it gets plugged into an external 24 '' lcd screen , so built in screen size is not terribly important .
1 at home and the office it gets plugged into an external 24" lcd screen , so built in screen size is not terribly important .
2 just beware no dvd slot so when i went to install software i had on cd i could n't .
1 i bought it to be able to dedicate a small , portable laptop to my writing and was surprised to learn that i needed to buy a word processing program to do so .
1 this version of macbook pro runs on a third-generation cpu ("ivy bridge") , not the latest fourth-generation haswell cpu the 2013 version has .
1 this version of macbook pro runs on a third-generation cpu -lrb- `` ivy bridge '' -rrb- , not the latest fourth-generation haswell cpu the 2013 version has .
2 no cd rom in the new version there 's no way i 'm spending that kind of money on something has less features than the older version .
2 the volume is really low to low for a laptopwas not expectin t volume to be so lowan i hate that about this computer
1 and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a case to protect it .
1 i got this at an amazing price from amazon and it arrived just in time .
1 every time i log into the system after a few hours , there is this endlessly frustrating process that i have to go through .
1 put a ssd and use a 21" led screen , this set up is silky smooth !
2 put a ssd and use a 21 '' led screen , this set up is silky smooth !
2 the case is now slightly larger than the previous generation , but the lack of an external power supply justifies the small increase in size .
4 i had to buy a wireless mouse to go with it , as i am old school and hate the pad , but knew that before i bought it , now it works great , need to get adjusted to the key board , as i am used to a bigger one and pounding .
2 when considering a mac , look at the total cost of ownership and not just the initial price tag .
5 has all the other features i wanted including a vga port , hdmi , ethernet and 3 usb ports .
1 the only thing i dislike about this laptop are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip .
1 it 's a decent computer for the price and hopefully it will last a long time .
2 the nicest part is the low heat output and ultra quiet operation .
1 i will upgrade the ram myself -lrb- because with this model you can you can do it -rrb- later on .
1 the price is 200 dollars down .
3 this mac mini does not have a built-in mic , and it would seem that its mac os 10.9 does not handle external microphones properly .
2 a lot of features and shortcuts on the mbp that i was never exposed to on a normal pc .
1 was n't sure if i was going to like it much less love it so i went to a local best buy and played around with the ios system on a mac pro and it was totally unique and different .
2 air has higher resolution but the fonts are small .
2 working with mac is so much easier , so many cool features .
2 i like the brightness and adjustments .
1 i only wish this mac had a cd/dvd player built in .
1 the only thing i miss is that my old alienware laptop had backlit keys .
1 the only thing i miss are the "home/end" type keys and other things that i grew accustomed to after so long .
1 so happy with this purchase , i just wish it came with microsoft word .
3 it has enough memory and speed to run my business with all the flexibility that comes with a laptop .
3 the speed , the simplicity , the design . . it is lightyears ahead of any pc i have ever owned .
3 the battery life is excellent , the display is excellent , and downloading apps is a breeze .
3 the screen , the software and the smoothness of the operating system .
1 i have dropped mine a couple times with only a slim plastic case covering it .
1 i also made a recovery usb stick .
2 but with this laptop , the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sounding tinny .
1 the built quality is really good , i was so happy and excited about this product .
1 i am loving the fast performance also .
3 further , this mac mini has a sloppy bluetooth interface -lrb- courtesy of the mac os -rrb- and the range is poor .
1 if you start on the far right side and scroll to your left the start menu will automatically come up .
1 my only gripe would be the need to add more ram .
1 fine if you have a touch screen .
2 as far as user type - i dabble in everything from games -lrb- wow -rrb- to photoshop , but nothing professionally .
1 i re-seated the "wlan" card inside and re-installed the lan device drivers .
1 i re-seated the `` wlan '' card inside and re-installed the lan device drivers .
2 this by far beats any computer out on the market today built well , battery life amazing .
1 the os is easy , and offers all kinds of surprises .
1 i had to get apple customer support to correct the problem .
5 a veryimportant feature is firewire 800 which in my experience works better then usb3 -lrb- in pc enabled with usb3 -rrb- i was not originally sold on the mac os i felt it was inferior in many ways to windows 7 .
4 i like itunes , the apparent security , the mini form factor , all the nice graphics stuff .
2 the first time i used the card reader it took half an hour and a pair of tweezers to remove the card .
2 after replacing the spinning hard disk with an ssd drive , my mac is just flying .
2 i know some people complained about hdmi issues but they released a firmware patch to address that issue .
1 with the needs of a professional photographer i generally need to keep up with the best specs .
1 packing and everything was perfect
1 i called toshiba where i gave them the serial number and they informed me that they were having issues with the mother boards .
2 i seem to be having repeat problems as the mother board in this one is diagnosed as faulty , related to the graphics card .
3 it also comes with 4g of ram but if you 're like me you want to max that out so i immediately put 8g of ram in her and i 've never used a computer that performs better .
1 this computer is also awesome for my sons virtual home schooling .
1 cost is more as compared to other brands .
6 also ... - excellent operating system - size and weight for optimal mobility - excellent durability of the battery - the functions provided by the trackpad is unmatched by any other brand -
1 this hardware seems to be better than the imac in that it is n't $ 1400 and smaller .
2 i 've had it for about 2 months now and found no issues with software or updates .
1 the latest version does not have a disc drive .
2 screen - although some people might complain about low res which i think is ridiculous .
