3 had a lovely dinner in this dedicated seafood joint , food was well-prepared and - presented and the service was pleasant and prompt .

1 i asked for a simple medium rare steak .
3 generously garnished , organic grilled burgers are the most popular dish , but the jerusalem market-style falafel wraps and mediterranean salads -- layered with beets , goat cheese and walnuts -- are equally scrumptious .

2 probably my worst dining experience in new york , and i 'm a former waiter so i know what i 'm talking about .
2 result -lrb- red velvet -rrb- : great texture , soft and velvety , nice hint of cocoa .
1 ask for the round corner table next to the large window .
2 their twist on pizza is heatlhy , but full of flavor .
1 the lack of ac and the fact that there are a million swarming bodies -lrb- although everyone is polite and no one is pushing -rrb- is a slight turn off .
2 i love the little pie company as much as anyone else who has written reviews , but must discourage anyone from visiting the grand central location due to their rude service from two sales people .
1 unfortunately , unless you live in the neighborhood , it 's not in a convenient location but is more like a hidden treasure .
1 did n't seem like any effort was made to the display and quality of the food .
1 the food -- though mostly deep-fried -- is simple and satisfying .
1 glechik might be way too tiny for a restaurant by russian standards , but it is cozy and the food is simply great .
2 the food was excellent - authentic italian cuisine made absolutely fresh .
1 at night the atmoshere changes turning into this hidden jewel that is waiting to be discovered .
4 the other times i 've gone it 's romantic date heaven , you can walk in get a booth by the windows , be treated like a vip in a not-crowded place , with great food and service .
1 i would only go for the coffee which is way better than starbucks or the like .
2 somewhat disappointing wine list -lrb- only new vintages .
3 if your looking for nasty high priced food with a dash of ghetto scenery cheap bx a$ $ this is the place to be !!
2 new hamburger with special sauce is ok - at least better than big mac !
3 perfectly al dente pasta , not drowned in sauce -- generous portions .
2 i can understand the prices if it served better food , like some chinese restaurants in midtown/uptown area .
2 service was awful - mostly because staff were overwhelmed on a saturday night .

1 the service was dreadfully slow -lrb- the place was only half full -rrb- and a smile would have been nice ...
2 i went this past saturday and had a excellent meal of consisting of a braised lamb shank with mashed potatoes .
3 the waitress came by to pick up the soy sauce while we were eating our lunch !!!!!
2 so we sat at the bar , the bartender did n't seem like he wanted to be there .
3 i reccomend the fried pork dumplings , the orange chicken/beef , and the fried rice .
1 you will not be dissapointed by any of the choices in the menu .
1 the french fries -- with the kalmata dip were terrific !
4 would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour wait , when they tell you it will be 20-30 minutes , the manager tells the bartender to spill the drinks you just paid for ?
1 the boutique selection of wines covers a wide variety without being imposeing .
2 they also have a great assortment of wraps if your not in the mood for traditional mediterranean fare .
13 fresh veggies , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , rice , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .
2 disappointingly , their wonderful saketini has been taken off the bar menu .
1 in short the black sheep distinguishes itself from the midtown pub herd with a look that 's a mix of sports-bar butch and ornate kitsch .
1 i would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard .
2 then she made a fuss about not being able to add 1 or 2 chairs on either end of the table for additional people .

2 i always find myself asking the waiter to make something bland and different than what is on the menu .

1 the closest that i got was the cherry marscapone , but they were out of it that day .
3 the homage to india is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer , a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce , while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated , fresh take on sweet-and-sour .

4 good place to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a glass of wine .
1 very nice touch that very much fits the place .
3 however , there is just something so great about being outdoors , in great landscaping , enjoying a casual drink that makes going to this place worthwhile .
1 we were seated promptly in close proximity to the dance floor .
1 if you are here as a pre-show meal , hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location .
3 the comments about fried foods is correct -lrb- below -rrb- but the other dishes , including the lamb entree and many of the salads -lrb- avocado shrimp -rrb- were quite good .

3 do n't ever bother - the drinks were awful , but it was the people who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining .

1 prices even outside of restaurant week were great .
2 a small , outdoor eating area makes for a private , comfortable space to study alone or meet up with friends .
1 and all the [female] servers are cute too , which is always nice .

2 satay is one of those favorite haunts on washington where the service and food is always on the money .
3 after dinner i heard music playing and discovered that there is a lounge downstairs .

2 i was especially impressed during the bday party when the waitstaff went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly service to a 15 person party .
2 the chicken and falafel platters were nondescript combinations with fresh leaf salad .
1 the atmosphere takes you to that place , the place many dream of .

2 the service is great -lrb- maybe even borderline nagging but at least you get attention -rrb- , the desserts are excellent and the coffee is so very good ...
2 they are served on focacchia bread and are to die for .
2 while the smoothies are a little big for me , the fresh juices are the best i have ever had !
2 the food is just okay , and it 's almost not worth going unless you 're getting the pialla , which is the only dish that 's really good .
2 the guac is fresh , yet lacking flavor , we like to add our fresh salsa into it .
2 the new menu has a few creative items , they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites -lrb- but they raised the prices -rrb- , the staff is friendly most of the time , but i must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words : no , ca n't , sorry ... , boy , they wo n't bend the rules for anyone .
2 it ' only open for lunch but the food is so good !
